# Spryker Feature: Reclamations

The Reclamations feature allows the shop administrators to handle order claims issued by customers. The shop administrators can create, view, and edit the reclamations in the dedicated section of the Administration Interface. The editing implies making a refund (depending on your state machine configuration) or closing the reclamation.

## Installation

```
composer require spryker-feature/reclamations
